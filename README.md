# Python SQL EDA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and SQL. It is designed to provide insights into data through visualizations and statistical analysis, serving as a valuable tool for data-driven decision making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: A high-level programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQLite**: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization in Python.
